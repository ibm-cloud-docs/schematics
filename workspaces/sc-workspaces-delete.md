# Deleting a workspace
{: #sch-delete-wks}

Deletes a workspace from the {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}. Deleting a workspace does not automatically remove the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that the workspace manages. Use workspace destroy to remove all resources that are associated with the workspace.

{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} deprecates older version of Terraform. For more information, see [Deprecating older version of Terraform process in {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-deprecate-tf-version#deprecate-timeline).
{: deprecated}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} deprecates creation of workspace using the {{site.data.keyword.terraform-provider_full_notm}} v1.2, v1.3 template from 2nd week of April 2024.

## Before you begin
{: #prerequisites-delete}

- [Create a Terraform configuration](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-config), and store the configuration in a `GitHub`, `GitLab`, or `Bitbucket` repository. You can also upload a tape archive file (`.tar`) from your local workstation to provide your template to {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}. For more information, see the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace upload`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload) command and see the [upload a `tar` file to your workspace](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#template-repo-upload) API.
- Make sure that you have the [permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to create a workspace.

Ensure the `location` and the `url` endpoint are pointing to the same region when you create or update the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces and actions. For more information about location and endpoint, see [Where is your information stored](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-secure-data#pi-location)?

### Verifying workspace delete 
{: #verify-wks-delete-cli}

Verify that the workspace are created successfully. When you destroy the resource by using the CLI, the command deletes the workspace completely.

```text
