# Activity tracking events for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}
{: #at_events}

You can view, manage, and audit user-initiated activities made in your {{site.data.keyword.bplong_full}} service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} service. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about).
{: shordesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to follow regulatory audit requirements. You can also be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected follow the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [Getting Started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

As of 28 March 2024, the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service is deprecated and will no longer be supported as of 30 March 2025. Customers will need to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} before 30 March 2025. During the migration period, customers can use {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} along with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. Activity tracking events are the same for both services. For information about migrating from {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and running the services in parallel, see [migration planning](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-intro).

### Launching {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}
{: #sc-log-launch-standalone}

## Analyzing {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} activity tracking events
{: #at_events_analyze}

### Creating a workspace
{: #at_analyze_wks}

When you create your first workspace, the following events are sent to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} owned service ID and {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

When you manage a workspace, the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service creates the following events:

- An event `schematics.instance.create`, when a first workspace is created.
- An event `schematics.instance.update`, when a workspace is modified.
- An event `schematics.instance.delete`, when a workspace is deleted.

The `initiatorId` of the request for these actions is set to a service ID where the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service owns.

In addition, when a workspace is created, more events are also generated:

- Event `schematics.tag.attach` to report tagging of the workspace
- Event `schematics.instance.create` to report the creation of the workspace instance in your account
- Event `schematics.instance.update` to report updates to the workspace properties

You can search by `target.id` to identify all events that report actions on a workspace. For example, you can use a query such as, `crn:v1:bluemix:public:schematics:eu-de:a/xxxxxx:xxxxxxx:workspace:eu-de.workspace.observability-workspace.xxxxxxxx`.

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} are automatically forwarded to your {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance based on the regions.

1. Create a service instance of [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started) in the `us-south/eu-de` region.
2. [Start the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web console](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch) to access your events.
