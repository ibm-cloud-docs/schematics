# Monitoring agent health
{: #agentb1-health}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong}} Agent performs a health check on the post deployment validation and in-use status of an agent.
{: shortdesc}

## Monitoring agent health using the CLI
{: #health-agentb1-cli}
{: cli}

To review the health of an agent by using the CLI, use the [agent health](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-agent-health) command. This command requires the `AGENT_ID` as an input argument.
{: shortdesc}

The output of an agent health command displays the list of relevant Kubernetes and agent health property names, the expected value, actual value, and the result as PASS or FAIL.

Example

```sh
ibmcloud schematics agent health --id agent-ga-prod-cli-jan-10.soA.cd1c  
```
{: pre}

Output

```text
Initiating agent health...
Job ID .ACTIVITY.f6f77588
```
{: screen}

Example

```sh
ibmcloud schematics agent get --id agent-ga-prod-cli-jan-10.soA.cd1c  
```
{: pre}

Output

## Health properties
{: #agent-health-property}

The following table describes the list of agent and Kubernetes health properties.

| Property name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| runtime | Health of the workspace and action job pods in an agent. |
| sandbox | Health of the Sandbox job pods in an agent, that are used to download Git repositories. |

## Monitoring agent health using API
{: #health-agentb1-api}
{: api}

Follow the [steps](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-api#cs_api) to retrieve your IAM access token and authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} by using the API. For more information about agent health API, see [get an agent health check](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#get-health-check-agent-job) job status. The agent health API displays the health status of your deployed agent.
{: shortdesc}

Example

```json
GET /v2/agent_health/agent-id-xx-000soB.347a/ HTTP/1.1
Host: schematics.cloud.ibm.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>
```
{: codeblock}

- When agent health deteriorates, you can review the current deployment and update the agent and the Kubernetes configuration as described in [Deploying agents](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-deploy-agent-overview&interface=cli).

- You can check out the [agent FAQ](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-faqs-agent) for many common questions.
