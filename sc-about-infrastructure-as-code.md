# What is Infrastructure as Code?
{: #infrastructure-as-code}

In simple terms, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is using code to manage and provision infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load-balancers, clusters, services and connection topology) in a descriptive model instead of manual processes.
{: shortdesc}

With IaC, configuration files define your infrastructure, which also makes it easier to edit, share, and reuse configurations. By codifying your infrastructure, you provision the same environment every time avoiding undocumented, ad hoc configuration changes.

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} utilizes open-source Ansible and Terraform to provide a powerful set of IaC tools as a service to program your cloud infrastructure. With {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} you can use this rich set of IaC automation capabilities to build stacks of cloud resources, manage their lifecycle, manage changes in their configurations, deploy your app workloads, and perform day-2 operations.

## Benefits of Infrastructure as Code
{: #iac-benefits}

Adopting an IaC approach to infrastructure deployment solves many common problems with provisioning infrastructure and delivers several benefits. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} enables you to realize these benefits without the need to install, run, and manage your own IaC tooling.
{: shortdesc}

- **Reliability and Consistency**: New environments or infrastructure are provisioned reliably. Manual processes result in mistakes. With IaC the same configurations are deployed over and over, repeatedly without differences. IaC improves consistency across environments and deployments.

- **Speed**: IaC enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure through automation. You apply it to every environment, from development to production, staging, QA, and more. This can lead to lower costs as the time to deploy, manage, and maintain environments decreases.

- **Tracking and accountability**: Changes to existing infrastructure are made in code, and the changes are tracked. Like any source code file, you have full traceability of the changes made to a configuration.

- **Detect and correct environment drift**: If a part of the infrastructure is modified manually outside of the code, it can be brought back in line with the desired state on the next run. [Drift detection](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-drift-note) is a feature of {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces.

## Best Practices 
{: #iac-best-practices}

When adopting IaC for provisioning and configuration management, there are number of recommended practices. These practices are fully supported when using {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

### Codifying everything in IaC
{: #iac-bp-codify}

All the infrastructure specifications should be explicitly coded in a configuration file, for instance as Terraform configurations or Ansible playbooks. The configuration files are the single source of truth of your infrastructure specification and describe what infrastructure components are used in their configuration?
{: shortdesc}

### Minimize documentation
{: #iac-bp-docs}

IaC is the documentation. With IaC in place, the configuration files represent the documentation and are always up-to-date, which reduces effort. The remaining documentation is about the process.
Maintain code in a Version Control System.
{: shortdesc}

IaC configuration files should be kept in a version control systems (VCS), like GitHub or GitLab. This provides an audit trail for code changes, but it also gives the opportunity to collaborate or peer review and test changes before they go live.

With this practice, you can easily track, manage, and revert any potential changes to your systems, with enhanced traceability and visibility.

### Testing
{: #iac-bp-testings} 

One of the practices that IaC borrows from software development is testing. Rigorous testing of infrastructure configuration plays a role in reducing post deployment issues. When combined with version control systems, testing can be automatically triggered every time there is a modification in the code.
{: shortdesc}

With Continuous Integration (CI) in place, the template infrastructure configuration can be implemented in multiple environments such as the `development`, `UAT`, `QA`, or `production` environment with minimal changes applied effectively.

### Modular Infrastructure
{: #iac-bp-modularity}

Breaking down infrastructure into [modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/documentation){: external} allows for reuse, improved reliability and an easier adoption path. Similar to the use of modules and packages in programming languages. Following are the benefits to this practice.
{: shortdesc}

- Frequently used configurations can be codified as modules and reused multiple times across environments.
- Reliability increases as modules can be tested and become hardened over time with use.
- Composition from reusable modules lowers the skills barrier to IaC adoption.
- Changes are easier to make and test at a module level.
- The risk of change reduces as configuration changes are localized.

### Declarative versus imperative approaches to IaC
{: #iac-declarative}

With adopting IaC, an aspect to consider is what approach your tooling takes. There are two different styles, declarative or imperative, also sometimes described as procedural.
{: shortdesc}

A declarative approach defines the desired state of the system, including the resources you need and any properties they should have, and the tool configures for you. The tool itself determines the operations to get to the desired state from any starting point.

An imperative approach instead defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration, and those commands then need to be executed in the correct order.

Chef is thought of as an imperative tool. Terraform is classed as declarative. Ansible is declarative but also can be used with imperative commands.

### Declarative Terraform and lifecycle management
{: #iac-declarative-lifecycle}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} supports both Terraform and Ansible as IaC tools with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces and actions. When lifecycle management is important with environments being regularly stood up and torn down, using Terraform with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces is recommended. Terraform keeps a record of the current state of your deployed cloud infrastructure and {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} is able to remove your infrastructure in reverse dependency order without manual intervention.
{: shortdesc}

### `Idempotence`
{: #iac-idempotence}

A benefit of the declarative approached used by Terraform and Ansible is `idempotence`. Idempotent tasks can be executed multiple times with the same end result. Irrespective of the previous state or starting place when restarting after failures, the provisioned infrastructure and configuration are always the same. This aspect is key to ensuring consistency and repeatability of environments deployed using {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

How you use a tool and the modules used both have an impact on `idempotency`. Generally, Terraform and Ansible modules are written to be idempotent. With both tools, code can we written that does not yield an idempotent result. In which case, the configuration may drift from the desired target state. With Terraform this form of drift is most likely when `null-resources` are used to extend provider functionality with custom scripts which are not idempotent.

Immutability is an IaC practice that minimizes the risk of drift from the target state.

### Immutable
{: #iac-immutability}

Immutable infrastructure refers to managing services and software deployments where resources like containers or virtual machines are replaced rather than changed (using scripts). The main desire here for immutability is avoiding configuration drift. Inconsistencies that arise due to local or manual changes, or differences in the sequence of automated operations. Changes that make it harder to debug and resolve issues, and increase support costs.
{: shortdesc}

To ensure immutability and eliminate drift, all changes should be made through the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} IaC configuration, and resources like VSIs should be redeployed when they need updating.
