# Protecting {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} services with context-based restrictions
{: #access-control-cbr}

Context-based restrictions give account owners and administrators the ability to define and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources based on the context of access requests. Access to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} services can be controlled using [context-based restrictions (CBR)](https://cloud.ibm.com/context-based-restrictions/overview){: external} and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. 
{: shortdesc}

## Managing CBR settings
{: #manage-cbr-settings}

With [context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis), you can define and enforce user and service access restrictions to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} based on specified criteria, for example IP address or {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources or services.
{: shortdesc}

To restrict access, you must be the account owner or have an access policy with the administrator role on all account management services.
{: note}

## Overview
{: #cbr-overview}

To restrict access to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, you create [network zones](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=ui#network-zones-create) that contain the IP addresses and services that you desire to grant access. Then apply these using [rules](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=ui#context-restrictions-create-rules).
{: shortdesc}

First, create a network zone containing the network IP addresses, VPCs, resources or services that you require to access {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. Then, attach that zone to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to restrict access. You can create zones and rules by using a RESTful [API](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#introduction) or with [context-based restrictions UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/context-based-restrictions/overview){: external}. After you create or update a zone or a rule, it might take a few minutes for the change to take effect.

You need to allowlist {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} in the CBR rules for other services if you require {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to connect to the service to perform post-configuration of service resources, for instance {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} PostgreSQL Database. If you configure a CBR rule for a service, for instance {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} cannot access a cluster in your account unless you include {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} in the CBR allowlist.

CBR rules do not apply to resource and service provisioning requests, only to the post-configuration of provisioned services.

Currently, CBR is supported by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} public endpoints in both `US` and `EU` regions. CBR support with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} private endpoints is limited to `EU` region only.
{: note}

If a CBR rule is blocking access to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, the  workspace page cannot list any workspaces. Other operations like workspace create, plan, and apply requests that are blocked by CBR are failed as access denied errors.
{: important}

## Understanding network zones
{: #cbr-network-zones}

By creating network zones, you can define an allowlist of network locations where {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} access requests originate, to determine when a rule can be applied. The list of network locations can be specified by using IP addresses, such as individual addresses, ranges or subnets, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) IDs, or {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services. 
{: shortdesc}

After you create a network zone, you can add it to a rule.

### Creating network zones by using the CBR API
{: #cbr-create-zones-api}
{: api}

The CBR API supports defining [network zones](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#introduction).
{: shortdesc}

Use `GET /v1/zones` to list the zones. By using `POST /v1/zones`, you can create a new zone with the appropriate information. For more information about the API request, see [Creating network zones by using the API](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=api#network-zones-create-api).

You can determine which services are available to include in a zone by checking the [reference targets](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#list-available-serviceref-targets).
{: note}

After you create zones, you can [update](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#replace-zone) or [delete](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-update&interface=ui#context-restrictions-remove-rules) them.

### Creating network zones by using the CBR UI
{: #cbr-create-zone-ui}
{: ui}

After you set the prerequisites and requirements, you can create zones in the UI. For more information about the steps to follow, see [Creating context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=ui#network-zones-create).
{: shortdesc}

After you create zones, they can also be [updated](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#replace-zone) and [deleted](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-update&interface=ui#context-restrictions-remove-rules).

## Understanding network rules
{: #cbr-network-rules}

After you create your zones, you can apply the zones to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to control access by creating rules. When you add zones to a rule, you can choose from the available [types of endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis#context-restrictions-endpint-type) that are relevant to how you access {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

### Create network rules by using the CBR API
{: #cbr-create-rules-api}
{: api}

You can define network rules with the API by using the information that you collected from creating network zones.
{: shortdesc}

By using `GET /v1/rules` with the endpoints that you chose, you can view a list of current rules. Use `POST /v1/rules` to create new rules. For more information about a request example, see [Creating rules by using the API](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=api#context-restrictions-create-rules-api).

After you create rules, you can [update](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#replace-rule) and [delete](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#delete-rule) them.

### Creating network rules by using the CBR UI
{: #cbr-create-rules-ui}
{: ui}

After you complete the prerequisites, you can create zones in the UI. For more information about the steps to follow, see [Creating context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=ui#network-zones-create).
{: shortdesc}

You can use the CBR UI to [add resources and contexts](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-create&interface=ui#context-restrictions-create-rules) to your network rules. 

Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions do not assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Also, the rules might not take effect immediately due to synchronization and resource availability.
{: important}

After you create rules, you can [update](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#replace-rule) and [delete](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#delete-rule) them. 

## Next steps
{: #cbr-next-steps}

You must follow the creation or modification of zones or rules with adequate testing to ensure access and {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service availability.
