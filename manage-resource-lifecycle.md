# Managing resources with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}
{: #manage-lifecycle}

Deploy, modify, and remove {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} to apply your Terraform templates.
{: shortdesc}

## Deploying your resources
{: #deploy-resources}
{: ui}

Deploy your `Terraform configs` to provision, or modify your Cloud resources with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

### Before you begin
{: #deploy-resources-prereq}

- [Create a workspace from UI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-create-wks&interface=ui#create-wks-ui) or create a [workspace through CLI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload). 
- Make sure that you have the required [IAM permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to deploy the resources in the target{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

### To deploy your resources
{: #to-deploy-resources}

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, select the workspace for the Terraform template that you want to apply.

   Sample templates examples are listed in [Cloud {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}](https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics){: external} GitHub, you can use one of the template for testing. For example, [Easy multizone VPC](https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/easy-multizone-vpc){: external}.
   {: note}

2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. In the **Details** section, click **Pull latest** to get the latest version of your Terraform template from the linked GitHub source repository. If you provided your Terraform template by uploading a tape archive file (`.tar`), you must use the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace upload`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload) command to provide a new version of your template.
4. Optional: Review the variables that you set for your workspace. The values of your variables are used where ever the you reference the variable in your Terraform template.
5. Click **Generate plan** to create a Terraform execution plan. After you click this button, the workspace **Jobs** page opens and {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} runs a `terraform plan` to compare the state of the resources that you already provisioned in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account with the resources that you want to provision with your Terraform template. 
6. Click **Jobs** to review the log of your execution plan. The execution plan includes a summary of the Cloud resources that creates, modifies, or deletes to achieve the state that you described in your Terraform template. If you have syntax errors in your Terraform configuration files, you can review the error message in the log file. 
7. Review available service plans and pricing information for each of the Cloud resources that {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} is about to create or change. Some services come with a limit per {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If you are about to reach the service limit for your account, the resource is not provisioned until you increase the service quota, or remove existing services first. 
8. When you are ready, apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**. This action equals the `terraform apply` command. After you click the button, {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} starts provisioning, modifying, or deleting your Cloud resources based on what actions were identified in the execution plan. Depending on the type and number of resources that you want to provision or modify, this process might take couple of minutes, or even up to hours to complete. During this time, you cannot make changes to your workspace. After all updates are applied, the state of your Cloud resources is stored in a Terraform state file that {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} uses to determine what resources exist in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

    If you want to stop applying your Terraform template, you can use the **Stop** button. Note that all resources that are already created are not removed. If a resource is currently provisioning, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} waits for the provisioning to complete, and then stops the creation, update, or deletion of any other resources in your Terraform template.
    {: note}

9. Review the job log to ensure that no errors occurred during the provisioning, modification, or deletion process. 
10. From the navigation, select **Resources** to find a summary of Cloud resources that are available in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Updating your resources
{: #update-resources}
{: ui}

To update Cloud resources, update your Terraform template with the required changes that must be performed on the resources.  
{: shortdesc}

Depending on the configuration change, Terraform may not be able to update your resource in place. Instead, Terraform need to first delete the resource and create a new resource. If Terraform identifies a resource to be removed and recreated, make sure that you do not interrupt a working environment, or delete data.
{: note}

To update your resources:

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, select the workspace that points to the Terraform template that you updated. 
2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. In the **Details** section, click **Pull latest** to get the latest version of your Terraform template from the linked GitHub source repository. If you provided your Terraform template by uploading a tape archive file (`.tar`), you must use the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace upload`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload) command to provide a new version of your template.
4. If you want to change the variable values that you set when you created the workspace, change the variable values.
5. Click **Generate plan** to create a Terraform execution plan. Note that during this time, you cannot make changes to your workspace. 
6. Click **Jobs** to review the log of your execution. The job log provides a summary of all the resources that {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} is about to modify. {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} might not be able to modify some of your resources, and suggest removing and re-creating the resource.
7. Click **Apply plan** to apply the new Terraform template version. Depending on the changes that you made, it might take couple of minutes or up to few hours for the template to be applied. Note that during this time, you cannot make changes to your workspace.

    If you want to stop applying your Terraform template, you can use the **Stop** button. Note that updates to resources that were already performed are not reverted. If a resource is currently updating, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} waits for the update to complete, and then stops the creation, update, or deletion of any other resources in your Terraform template.
    {: note}

8. Review the job log to ensure that no errors occurred during the modification process. 
9. From the navigation, select **Resources** and verify that your resources show the updated configuration.

## Managing drift between your cloud environment and Terraform configuration
{: #drift-report}
{: ui}

Managing deviations between the real-world state of your cloud environment and your infrastructure code, also referred to as `drift`, is a key challenge when implementing infrastructure as code. Deviations can happen for many reasons, such as: 

- You added, updated, or removed resources in your Terraform configuration file without running your infrastructure code.
- You manually added, updated, or removed {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} without Terraform.
- You used other automation tools, such as scripts to manipulate the state of your Cloud resources.
{: shortdesc}  

Refer to using the workspace [drift detection](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-drift-note&interface=ui) feature.

## Reviewing resource and deployment details
{: #review-logs}
{: ui}

View the details of the {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} deployments and the Cloud resources that you currently manage with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, select the workspace that you want to inspect.
2. From the navigation, select **Settings** to find a summary of activities in your workspace.
3. Review the logs of previous Terraform execution plans and the plans that you applied. 
4. From the navigation, select **Resources** to review the state of the Cloud resources that you created with this workspace. 
5. To review who made a change to your Terraform template, go to the source repository in GitHub that is linked to your workspace, and use the built-in capabilities such as the commit history and pull requests to review changes.
6. To review events that {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} sent to {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} events](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-at_events).

## Removing your resources
{: #destroy-resources}
{: ui}

To remove an Cloud resource that you provisioned with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, you can either remove your resources with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, delete your workspace, or remove the infrastructure code in the Terraform template. 
{: shortdesc}

Removing an Cloud resource cannot be undone. Make sure that you backed up your data before you remove a resource. If you choose to remove the infrastructure code, or comment out the resource in your Terraform configuration file, make sure to thoroughly review the log file of your execution plan to verify that all your resources are included in the removal.
{: important}

**To remove resources by removing the resource config in your Terraform template:**

1. Open the Terraform configuration file in your source repository in GitHub or on your local machine. 
2. Either remove the infrastructure code from the file, or comment out the resources that you want to remove by adding `#` to the beginning of each line.

    **Example to remove a resource by commenting out a resource definition:**

    ```terraform
    # resource ibm_is_instance "vsi1" {
    #  name    = "${local.BASENAME}-vsi2"
    #  vpc     = ibm_is_vpc.vpc.id
    #  zone    = "${local.ZONE}"
    #  keys    = [data.ibm_is_ssh_key.ssh_key_id.id]
    #  image   = data.ibm_is_image.ubuntu.id
    #  profile = "cc1-2x4"

    #  primary_network_interface {
    #    subnet          = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
    #    security_groups = [ibm_is_security_group.sg1.id]
    #  }
    #}
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. Commit the change to your Terraform configuration file. 
4. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, select the workspace for the Terraform template that you just changed. 
5. From the navigation, select **Settings**. 
6. In the **Details** section, click **Pull latest** to get the latest version of your Terraform template from the linked GitHub source repository. If you provided your Terraform template by uploading a tape archive file (`.tar`), you must use the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace upload`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload) command to provide a new version of your template.
7. Click **Generate plan** to create a Terraform execution plan. The workspace **Jobs** page opens. Note that during this time, you cannot make changes to your workspace.
8. Click **Jobs** to review the log of your execution plan. The log provides a summary of all the resources that {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} is about to remove. 
9. Click **Apply plan** to remove the Cloud resources from your account.

    If you want to stop applying your Terraform template, you can use the **Stop** button. Note that all resources that are already removed are not re-created. If a resource is currently deleting, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} waits for the deletion to complete, and then stops the creation, update, or deletion of any other resources in your Terraform template.
    {: note}

10. Review the log files to ensure that no errors occurred during the deletion process.
11. From the navigation, select **Resources** and verify that your resources are removed.
12. Optional: After you removed all your resources, remove your workspace.
    1. Open the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external} and find the workspace that you want to remove.
    2. Click **Actions** tab and select **Delete workspace** option.
    3. Type your workspace name in **Type `workspace_name` to confirm** text box.
    4. Click **Delete** button.

**To remove resources using the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} console:**

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, find the workspace that includes the resources that you want to delete.
2. Click **Actions** tab and select **Destroy resources** option.
3. Type your workspace name in **Type `workspace_name` to confirm** text box. Note that destroying resources removes the resources from your workspace and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This action cannot be undone.
4. Click **Destroy** button.
5. From the navigation, select **Jobs** to review the logs for your resource deletion. Ensure that no errors occurred during the deletion process.
