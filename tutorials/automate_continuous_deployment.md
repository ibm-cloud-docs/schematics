# Setting up continuous deployment with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} and a DevOps toolchain
{: #workspace-continuous-deployment}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="schematics, continuous-deployment"}
{: toc-completion-time="60m"}

## Description
{: #workspace-desc}

In this tutorial, you can learn to use your credentials and an API key to use a Terraform template of {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} in the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace. Then, you also learn to automate the continuous deployment by using DevOps delivery pipeline. As part of the tutorial, you use `ibm_cos_bucket` Terraform template example.

The `ibm_cos_bucket` example creates an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Activity Tracker, and {{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull}}.

Costs are incurred based on your resource usage. For more information about the pricing, see [Pricing](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges). About the support and help, see [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} help](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-help).
{: important}

## Objectives
{: #workspace-obj}

In this tutorial, you can:

- Explore an IBM provided Terraform template to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage instance that binds with the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} resource instance, and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} resource group.
- Learn how to create an {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} workspace.
- Learn to automate continuous deployment of a resource by using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and DevOps toolchain.
- Review the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you create.

## Time needed
{: #workspace-timereq}

1 hour

## Audience
{: #workspace-tut-audience}

This tutorial is intended for the developer and system administrators who want to learn how to use Terraform templates to create. And automate the continuous deployment of resource by using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and DevOps toolchain.

## Prerequisites
{: #workspace-prereq}

### About {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}
{: #wks-preqre-abt-sch}

[{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started) is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation tool. It provides simplified provisioning, orchestrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC), templates, and managing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment by using various resources tools such as Terraform, Helm.
IaC helps you codify your cloud environment to automate the provisioning, speeds deployment, and managing your resources. The infrastructure is treated the same way as your app code, so that you can automate the DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, continuous integration, and deployment.
{: shortdesc}

### About DevOps toolchain
{: #wks-preqre-abt-devops}

A DevOps toolchain is a set of tools that automates the tasks of developing and deploying your app. A toolchain is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks. The collective power of a toolchain is greater than the sum of its individual tool integrations.

For the information, see [DevOps toolchain](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-devsecops_intro). The {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} option enables the continuous delivery of your infrastructure configurations as well with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} toolchain.

Complete the following prerequisites for the tutorial:

- If you do not have {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, and pay as you use. For more information about managing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, see [Managing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
- Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli#install-schematics-cli) and the [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} CLI plug-in](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli#install-schematics-plugin). For more information about command-line setup, see [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} command-line setup](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli).
- Ensure you are assigned the needed permissions in {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} to create and work with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} workspace. see [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} access](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access#access-roles) and to create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance. 
- Follow the instructions to ensure you are assigned the needed permissions in {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} to create resources. For more information about create {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-provision).

## Accessing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and GitHub
{: #access-automate-template}
{: step}

## Automating the continuous deployment process
{: #continuous-deployment}
{: step}

The `Enable continuous delivery` option automates the different Terraform actions to the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace. Complete these steps to observe the automation of the end to end {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces deployment.

The GitHub Server type parameter expects the authorization. You need to provide GitHub credentials and confirm the authorization.
{: note}

1. On the variable page, click `Enable continuous delivery` link option to view {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Infrastructure as Code Tekton Toolchain page.
2. Click `Delivery Pipeline Required` tab.
3. Enter your `{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key`. 
4. Click **Authorize** > **Authorize IBM-Cloud** and enter your GitHub password to get authorized.
5. Click `Create` to view Toolchains page.
6. Click `Deliver Pipeline` pane to view {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}-deploy Dashboard page. 
7. Click **Run Pipeline**

    Observe the `UPDATE` is in `STAGE RUNNING` state, without the click.
    {: note}

## Analyzing the pipeline execution process
{: #analyze-deployment}
{: step}

Observe the pipeline dashboard and view the status of your workspace execution.
{: shortdesc}

1. During the update stage process, from the example of `ibm-cos-bucket` repository observe the `main.tf` file configuration with the `cos_instance` name and `bucket_name`. These details are updated in the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces after the APPLY stage is passed.
2. The `UPDATE` stage completes, PLAN stage is in running state.
3. Click **Jobs** and history to view the status of the job from the `PLAN` pane.
4. Observe that the PLAN stage is passed, and APPLY stage is in running state.
5. From the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces, check that the resource name and bucket name are created successfully.
6. Observe that the `APPLY` stage is passed and TEST stage is in `Running` state.
7. Observe that the `TEST` stage is passed successfully.
8. Now, you can edit your template in the configured repository and observe an automatic pull of your workspace by the continuous delivery toolchain.

## Analyzing the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace
{: #analyze-workspace-process}
{: step}

Alternatively, through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard, you can view the status of the workspace.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}.
2. Select `Navigation Menu > {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} > Workspaces > Resources` to observe the apply state of the resources in your workspace.
3. You can view the output from your working directory, or from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard plan logs to view the workspace status.

You successfully created the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces and automated the end to end deployment by using the DevOps toolchain.
