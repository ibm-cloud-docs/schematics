# Ansible
{: #actions-faq}

Answers to common questions about the {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} actions are classified into following section.
{: shortdesc}

## Are Classic VSIs supported for use with actions? 
{: #Classic-vsi-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

Classic VSI environments are not supported with actions.  Only {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC VSIs have been tested and are supported with actions.

## What network configuration is suggested for use with actions? 
{: #network-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

It is your responsibility as a user to ensure that suitable network policies and a bastion host configuration is in place for the cloud environment to allow {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to connect through SSH to your environment. See [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} firewall, allowed IPs](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-allowed-ipaddresses) for details of the IP addresses {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} uses and must be allowed access. When using a bastion host, SSH forwarding is used to connect to the target VSIs. To validate access the command `ssh -J bastion-ip vsi-ip`.

Example as-is {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC configurations with bastion hosts are available in the [Cloud-Schematics repo](https://github.com/orgs/Cloud-Schematics/repositories?q=bastion&type=all&language=&sort=){: external}. Follow the tutorial [Discover best-practice VPC configuration for application deployment](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/secure-vpc-access-with-a-bastion-host-and-terraform/) for guidance on creating a suitable network configuration.

## Why does the SSH connection fail with static inventory files?
{: #ssh-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

Defining target hosts using short form host names is not supported for VSIs on a private network without public IP addresses. The connection fails with the message `Could not resolve hostname`. Review the [actions docs](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-inventories-setup#static-host-defs) for supported configurations.

```

## Why does my action job display a DEPRECATION WARNING message?
{: #deprecation-warn-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

In the action settings page you, need to set the input variable as `ansible_python_interpreter = auto` as shown in the screen capture to avoid `DEPRECATION WARNING` message.

WinRM is not supported by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Terraform Ansible provisioner. Alternatively you can use the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions to run the Ansible playbooks with WinRM. The {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions support [WinRM](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-action-working).

## When are new Terraform and Ansible versions added to {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}?
{: #new-versions}
{: faq}
{: support}

After new Terraform and Ansible versions are released by the community, the IBM team begins hardening and testing the release for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. Availability of new versions depends on the results of these tests, community updates, security patches, and technology changes between versions. Make sure that your Terraform templates and Ansible playbooks are compatible with one of the supported versions so that you can run them in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. For more information, see [Upgrading the Terraform template version](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-migrating-terraform-version) and [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} runtime tools](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-utilities#sch-runtime-tf-job).

## Can I run Ansible playbooks with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}?
{: #ansible-playbooks}
{: faq}
{: support}

Yes, you can run Ansible playbooks against your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions or Ansible provisioner in your Terraform configuration file. For example, use the Ansible provisioner to deploy software on Cloud resources or set actions against your resources, such as shutting down a virtual server instance. For more information, see [sample Ansible playbook templates for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sample_actiontemplates).
