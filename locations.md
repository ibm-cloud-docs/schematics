## Where is my {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} and template data stored?

The region your workspace data is stored is determined by the location where you create your workspace. For more information, see [Securing your data](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-secure-data). 

## Where are my {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources provisioned?
{: #where-are-resources-provisioned}

The region or regions where your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources are provisioned are determined by the region that you specify in your Terraform configuration. You can specify a region for each individual resource, or to specify a region in the `provider` block of your Terraform configuration that is applied to all resources. Multiple regions are supported by using provider aliases. For more information, see [Terraform `provider` block configuration](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference).
