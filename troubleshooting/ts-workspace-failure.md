{: tsSymptoms}

Your workspace create did not reach the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, due to the limitation of the `terraform.tfstate` file.
{: tsCauses}

The `terraform.tfstate` file must be less than 2 MB. When you create workspace from an existing Terraform state file, the `terraform.tfstate` file must be less than 2 MB. Greater than 2 MB state file is not supported in the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. Rerun the workspace create operation with less than 2 MB state file.
