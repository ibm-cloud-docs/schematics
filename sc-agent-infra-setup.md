# Deploying agent prerequisite infrastructure
{: #agent-infrastructure-overview}

Agents for {{site.data.keyword.bplong}} extend its ability to work directly to cloud infrastructure on the private network or in any isolated network zones.
{: shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #agents-setup-prereq}

The following prerequisites must be met before you begin deploying the agent infrastructure.

- You must have an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration){: external} account to proceed. For more information about managing your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Setting up your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started).
- Check whether you have the permissions to [provision a VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources), a [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-terraform-setup#terraform-cluster-IAM), and [logging service](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam_manage_events) in the target resource group.
- Check whether you have the [permission](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access#workspace-permissions) to create a workspace.

## Provisioning agent infrastructure using {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}
{: #agents-infra-workspace}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} provides a [sample template](https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/schematics-agents/tree/main/templates/infrastructure){: external} that you can use to provision the infrastructure needed by your agent. The Agent infrastructure is composed of the following resources.

- [VPC infrastructure](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started) as `public_gateways`, `subnets`.
- [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets) or [{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-learning-path-admin#admin_cluster) as `vpc_kubernetes_cluster`.

    To support agents on the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}, based on the requirement, you can control egress traffic through Security Groups and Network access control lists (ACLs). 
    You need to define any {{site.data.keyword.networksecuritygroups_short}} rules and ACLs at VPC level before deploying an agent on the cluster. For more information, see [Terraform script to define security groups and ACLs on VPC](https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/schematics-agents/blob/main/templates/infrastructure/vpc/network_acl.tf){: external}.
    {: note}

1. Log in to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.
2. Click the **Menu** icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Platform Automation** > **Schematics** > **Terraform** > [**Create workspace**](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/workspaces/create){: external} with the following inputs to create an Agent infrastructure workspace.
    - In the **Specify Template** section:
        - **`GitHub`, `GitLab`, or `Bitbucket` repository URL** - `https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/agent-infrastructure-sample/tree/main/templates/infrastructure`.
        - **Personal access token** - `<leave it blank>`. You can click the `Open reference picker` to select a your Secret Manager key reference. For more information, see [creating a Secret Manager instance](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance).
        - Terraform Version - `terraform_v1.5`. You need to select Terraform version 1.5 or greater than version.
        - Click `Next`.
    - In the **Workspace details** section:
        - **Workspace name** as `schematics-agent-infrastructure`.
        - **Tags** as `agents-infra`. 
        - **Resource group** as `default` or other resource group for this workspace. For more information, see [Creating a resource group](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs). You must have the access permission for the resource group.
        - **Location** as `North America` or other [region](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-multi-region-deployment) for this workspace. 
           If the location used for Agent infrastructure and Agent service does not match, then the logs are not sent to LogDNA.
           {: note}

        - Click `Next`.
        - Check the information that is entered are correct to create a workspace.
    - Click `Create`.

3. On successful creation of the `schematics-agent-infrastructure` Workspace, review and edit the `agent infrastructure` input variables in the workspace **Settings** page.

    The agent infrastructure and the workspace can be in different resource groups and locations. The agent infrastructure workspace can be defined in any {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} supported region.
    {: note} 

    | Input variable  | Data type | Required/Optional | Description |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | `agent_prefix` | String | `Required` | Provide the prefix for naming your agent VPC, cluster, and logging configuration.
    | `location`| String | `Required` | The region in the agent infrastructure VPC and cluster are created in. |
    | `resource_group_name` | String | `Required` | Name for the resource group used the agent infrastructure and agent are associated to. For example, **`test_agent`**. For more information, see [Creating a resource group](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs). You must have the access permission for the resource group. |
    | `ibmcloud_api_key` | String | `Optional` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key used to provision the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent infrastructure resources. If not provided, resources provisions in currently logged in user credentials.|
    | `tags` | List(String) | `Optional` | A list of user tags to be applied to the deployed, VPC, and cluster. For example, `myproject:agent`, `test:agentinfra`. You can see the provisioned resources of an Agent faster by using Tag name. |
    {: caption="{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent infrastructure inputs" caption-side="bottom"}

4. Click **Apply plan** on the `schematics-agent-infrastructure` workspace to provision the agent infrastructure. It takes up to 45 - 90 minutes to provision all the resources.  
5. View the **Jobs** logs and **Resources** page to monitor the resources are provisioned successfully and verify that the workspace status is now `ACTIVE`.

    Record the `cluster_id` and `logdna_name` from the `Outputs:` section of the Jobs log. This information is used when deploying the agent. If the job fails and you do not observe the `cluster_id` details in the Jobs log, you must have the IAM permissions to create `VPC Infrastructure`, and `Kubernetes cluster` services. Then, click **Apply plan** to redeploy the agent infrastructure. 
    {: important}

### Expected outcome
{: #agents-setup-infra-output}

Follow the steps to view the Agent infrastructure workspace setup.

1. Navigate to the [Resources list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources/){: external} page.
2. Verify that the following resources are provisioned from the resource list page.
    - **VPC > Search** `<agent_prefix>-vpc` the status as **Available**.
    - **Services and Software** > `<agent_prefix>-logdna` the status as **Active**.
    - **Clusters** > `<agent_prefix>-iks` the status as **Normal**.

    Optional, you can search the provisioned resources with the user tag you specified in the [Resources list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources/){: external} page.
