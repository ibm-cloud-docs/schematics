# Detecting drift in workspaces
{: #drift-note}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong}} enables users to deploy, manage, and manipulate infrastructure resources with Terraform based workspaces using `declarative` Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts. However, when a Terraform config is deployed and resources are created, it does not mean that the resourcesÂ stay as declared by the config. Any change in the infrastructure state is called `drift`. It occurs when your deployed infrastructure differs from the wanted (declarative) state defined by your template configuration.

Drift can occur for many reasons. The most frequent cause is changes made to your infrastructure manually outside of Terraform automation. The Terraform state file of your deployed workspace is then no longer synchronized with your deployed infrastructure resources, and the workspace is said to be in drift.
{: shortdesc}

Drift can happen for many reasons within the context of your configuration:

- Adding, or removing resources from the Template configuration without applying the changes. 
- Changing template resource definitions. 
- External to your template configuration, drift occurs when changes are made manually. For example, from a command line operation on a cloud resource, or change through the cloud console. 
- Can occur through other automation tools.

## Example drift scenario
{: #drift-scenario}

A VSI instance is provisioned by using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and a configuration template. A DevOps cloud user can modify the provisioned VSI configuration by logging in to the Cloud console and modifying the boot volume of an instance or adding an Ethernet interface. These changes result in your infrastructure deployment in `drift`.

{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} enables, to predictably [manage the resource lifecycle](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-manage-lifecycle) of your infrastructure by using Terraform. Drift occurs when the real-world state of your infrastructure differs from the state that is defined in your Terraform template configuration. 

Terraform cannot detect drift in resources and attributes that are not managed or configured by using Terraform. For example, Terraform cannot not detect changes in a virtual machine that results from installing applications locally or by using configuration management tools like `Chef` or `Ansible`.

## Drift detection in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #drift-in-ibm}

Drift detection for your Terraform automation workspaces is possible in {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}. You can use following three methods to check the drift detection.

## Drift detection using the UI
{: #drift-ui}
{: ui}

You can initiate drift detection for workspaces from the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace job page. It initiates a job to detect drift for the workspace and its deployed resources. During execution, the drift detection job is `in progress`, on completion it has a `failure` or `success`. To review the details of the drift job, you need to check the drift job log for the drift status.

### Viewing detect drift logs using the UI
{: #drift-view-ui}

Use the following steps to view the drift job log.

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/automation/schematics/terraform){: external}, select the workspace that you want check for drift. 
2. Select and open your workspace.
3. Select the **Actions** drop down list.
4. Select **Detect drift** option to initiate the detect drift job. 
5. During execution, the status shows `in progress` moving to a `success` or a job `failure` status on completion. 
6. The drift status can be determined by reviewing the output of the job logon when the job is in a `success` state. A sample success job execution with detected drift is shown in the screen capture.

    Review the success job log to identify the drift details.

    If the job fails, review the cause of the failure in the log, and correct the error condition by rerunning the job.
    {: note}

    A failure example job log identifies the cause of the drift job failure.

## Drift detection using the CLI
{: #drift-cli}
{: cli}

You can initiate detecting drift from the create workspaces command. The drift detection initiates a job to detect drift for the workspace and its specific resources. The drift detection job is `in progress` or `completed` with the appropriate status such as `failure` or `success`. Instead, to know the details of the drift job, you need to check the drift job log for the drift status. Use the following commands to view the detect drift.

### Creating and viewing the detect drift logs using the CLI
{: #drift-view-cli}
{: cli}

You can follow these steps to detect the drift in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces using the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Create the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspaces](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-new).
2. [Get your workspace ID](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-get).
3. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics plan`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-plan).
4. Fetch the [`ibmcloud schematics job logs`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-logs-job).
5. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics apply`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-apply).
6. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics job run`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-run-job) to create a job in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics job run --command-object workspace --command-object-id <workspace_id> --command-name drift
    ```
    {: pre}

7. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace action`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-action) to retrieve all activities of your workspace.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics workspace action --id <workspace_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics job logs`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-logs-job) to retrieve the detailed logs of a job to view the drift details.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics logs --id <workspace_id> --act-id <Job_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

## Creating and viewing the detect drift through API 
{: #drift-api}
{: api}

Review the CURL commands to create and view the drift through API.
{: shortdesc}

1. Retrieve your IAM access [steps](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-api#cs_api) to authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}.
2. [Create the workspace](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#create-workspace). As part of the payload you need to add the following drift configuration.

    ```terraform
    {
        commands: [
            {
            command: 'drift',
            command_name: 'drift command',
            command_desc: 'command to detect drift in workspace resources',
            },
        ],
        operation_name: 'drift',
        description: 'command to detect drift in workspace resources',
        }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. [Get the workspace details](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#get-workspace).
4. Run the [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} job plan](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#plan-workspace-command).
5. Fetch the [`ibmcloud schematics job logs`](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#get-template-activity-log).
6. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics apply`](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#apply-workspace-command).
7. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics job run`](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#run-workspace-commands) to create a job for your workspace.
8. Run the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace action`](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#create-job) to retrieve all activities of your workspace.
9. Fetch the [`ibmcloud schematics job logs`](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#get-template-activity-log).
